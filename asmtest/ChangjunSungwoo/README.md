Test case

1. Partial Sum(loop)
This function is for summing the numbers from a0(first parameter) to a1(second parameter).
If a1 is smaller than a0, it returns 0.
This function uses the instructions of J, JR, JAL, BNE, ADDI, ADD, SLT.


2. Partial Sum(recursion)
The purpose of this function is same with (1). The implementation is different. It uses recursion
This function uses the instructions of SW, LW, JR, JAL, BNE, ADDI, ADD, SLT.
